# simple-flashcards-program
Simple Python program to test yourself using user-created flashcards.

Sets of cards are divided into directories in the "card_sets" folder. The cards themselves are simply text files where the first line is the title/question and the second line is the answer.
The testing is honesty-based as after each card, the user will be asked if they got it right or wrong.

The order of the cards will be randomized before each test for a better testing experience.

Run test.py to test yourself on a card set.
Run create_cards.py to create a new set or add to an existing one
